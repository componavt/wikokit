'''Consciousness''' is a quality of the [[mind]] generally regarded to comprise qualities such as [[subjectivity]], [[self-awareness]], [[sentience]], [[sapience]], and the ability to [[perception|perceive]] the relationship between [[personal identity|oneself]] and one's [[environment]].  In common parlance, ''consciousness'' denotes being [[awake]] and responsive to one's environment; this contrasts with being [[sleep|asleep]] or being in a [[coma]].

Consciousness is notoriously difficult to define or locate.  Many cultures and religious traditions place the seat of consciousness in a [[soul]] separate from the body.  Conversely, many scientists and philosophers consider consciousness to be intimately linked to the neural functioning of the [[brain]].

An understanding of necessary preconditions for consciousness in the human brain may allow us to address important ethical questions. For instance, to what extent are non-human animals conscious? At what point in fetal development does consciousness begin? Can machines ever achieve conscious states? These issues are of great interest to those concerned with the ethical treatment of other beings, be they [[animal rights|animals]], [[abortion|fetuses]], or in the future, [[artificial consciousness|machines]].
