    Now one language can have several language codes and several names.

    Added error message for the case the Wiktionary article about foreign word contains translation section.
    Fixed bug: now the parsing of "{{заголовок|de|add=|aare}}" is correct when the parameter "add=" is empty. Now Aare is not Russian, but German word :)
