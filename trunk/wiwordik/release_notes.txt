    Version number has been changed. XX.X.YYYY where XX.X - version 
      and YYYY - number of languages and codes recognized by the program 
      and extracted from the Wiktionary (see about language codes 
      http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_639-3).
      So "0.05.1053" means: program version 0.05, the parser recognizes 
      1053 language codes.
