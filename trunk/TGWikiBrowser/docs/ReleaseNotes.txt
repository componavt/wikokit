Release Notes:

V 1.02 (06/11/02): 

  Added features:
  * Allowed LinkDatabase to be read from URL instead of a file, thanks to
    Bill Seitz for the idea.

  * BrowserLauncher now works for Windows NT/XP thank to a fix by 
    Christoph Drieschner.

V 1.01 (04/19/02):
  
  Added features:
  * A new type of node representing pages external to the wiki has been added.
    If an external URL has been mentioned repeatedly on several wiki pages,
    one will see multiple incoming edges for the corresponding node.    
  * Added a Show BackLinks checkbox which allows back links to be shown or
    hidden.
  * Added a Stop button which stops the graph motion and the animation.
  * Added a Help button for getting quick directions.  
  * Added tool tips to controls.
  * Cursor icon changes when hoviring over a node and when dragging the
    background.
  * Fixed the HideNode function, so that the selected node can be hidden, and
    added a CollapseNode option.
  * Status bar in html pane is now a button which can be clicked to bring up
    the page in an external browser.
  * Status bar shows associated URL when the mouse is hovered oven a node.
  * Nodes with high incident edge counts are not automatically expanded when    
    selected from the browser pane, which allows for pages such as RecentChanges
    to be viewed without problem.
  * Setting the page in the browser pane is now done via a thread, which keeps
    the tool from freezing while the requested page is being fetched.
  
  Potential improvements:
  * Intra-wiki links should also have corresponding nodes shown in the graph.
  * LinkDatabase is still stored locally instead of being dynamically aquired.
  * Nodes hidden because they have too many incident edges should be shown in 
    a separate pane.

V 1.00 (03/12/02): 
  
  Current features:
  * Searching for wiki pages
  * Zooming
  * A back button
  * Controlling which nodes are displayed with the locality radius, and by 
    setting a maximum edge degree at which nodes are not shown, and a maximum at 
    which nodes are not expanded.
  * Hilighting the associated node in the graph on hyperlink mouseover in the 
    html browser pane.
  * Status bar displaying hyperlink url / indicating if the link is local to the 
    wiki.
  * For local links, status bar shows associated node edge degree + sets text 
    color to red for links with a high edge degree.

  Potential improvements:
  *  The current link database only provides information about node 
     interconnections.  A richer database would produce a more interesting 
     looking graph, for instance people nodes could be colored differendly then 
     idea nodes.
  *  The link data obtained in small amounts from the server, rather then 
     stored as one large chunk.  This would maintain a real-time correspondance
     between the graph and wiki-structure (the current database needs to be 
     updated manually).
