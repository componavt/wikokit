Synarcher 0.12.5 2008-04-06
  241 tests passed, 6 tests failed
  This version is devoted to Index Wiki Database (WikIDF) creation.

  WikIDF is a console application (part of Synarcher program), which 
  depends on the RuPOSTagger program, see http://rupostagger.sourceforge.net

  The Wiki Index Database is a list of lemmas and links to wiki pages, 
  which contain these lemmas. The Wiki Index Database now could be 
  created with the help of new upper (or sub) project WikIDF, 
  see synarcher/wikidf/readme.txt

  The created index DB for Russian and Simple English Wikipedia 
  are available at: http://rupostagger.sourceforge.net, 
  see packages idfruwiki and idfsimplewiki.

  Added (from user's point of view)
    Nothing

  Added (from programmer's point of view)
    WikiParsers.java converts wiki-texts to texts in natural language.
    LanguageType.java with list of all Wikipedia languages.
    WikimediaSisterProject.java with codes of Wikimedia sister projects.
    Package wikipedia.sql_idf as API for Wikipedia index database (WikIDF),
        see example in synarcher/wikidf/src/wikidf/ExampleAPI.java.

  171 tests passed, 8 tests failed
  Added
    New Category tab was added to search panel. Category tab contains list of 
        categories sorted by number of articles which belongs to it.
    "The WordSimilarity-353 Test Collection" was taken (thanks to Evgeniy 
        Gabrilovich) from http://www.cs.technion.ac.il/~gabr/resources/data/wordsim353/wordsim353.html
        and converted to Java file, see wikipedia.experiment.WordSim353.java
        It helps to evaluate results of search by an adapted HITS (AHITS) 
        algorithm (Synarcher engine) in two tests.
    Test 1. Comparison AHITS with human similarity estimation. See 
        instructions in the file 
        synarcher/kleinberg/src/wikipedia/experiment/Valuer.java
    Test 2. Calculation of Resnik Information Content metric in WP.
        See instructions in the file synarcher/sql_procedures/hyponyms/readme_ic.txt
        See code and bibliography in the file 
        synarcher/kleinberg/src/wikipedia/experiment/Hyponyms.java
    During second test 526 cycles of categories was found in English Wikipedia,
        see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:AKA_MBG/Cycles

  Bug fixed
    'Expand categories' works for the source article (with title entered by 
        user).
    Russian user interface instead of English: MessagesBundle.properties 
        renamed to MessagesBundle_en.properties

  Todo
    Cache results of previous search by AHITS to the database idfenwiki.


Synarcher 0.12.3 2007-06-26
  156 tests passed, 5 tests failed
  Added
    Redirects are taken into account now. They are presented as green nodes. 
        They are connected by green arcs to the redirect article.
    Categories of redirect pages are taken into account, i.e. redirect pages 
        are now filtered by black list of categories.
    Preprocessing of search word: trim spaces, upper-case first letter.
    Tab 'Result' is colored in case of 'No synonyms were found'
    Added option: skip titles with columns, e.g. Portal:Literature

  Bug fixed
    Fix error with SQL connection: now connection is checked (isValid()) and 
        reopened.

  Improved
    Speed-up search for synonyms: 
        - skip search for categories in black list if it is empty.
        - skip the article if it is in pl_from (Links.GetLToByLFrom).
        - rewrite link.GetAllLinks, renamed it to getAllLinksFromNodes
    Code clean-up: types of nodes are defined in NodeTypes.java: BASE, ROOT, etc.

Synarcher 0.12.2 2007-01-05
    Added categories counter (Database/"Get statistics")
    Added checkbox 'Skip titles with spaces' in tab Synonyms/Parameters
    Added checkbox 'Random pages (base set forming)' in tab Synonyms/Parameters
    The interwiki links are skipped now (it is corrected 
        the SQL Exception:"absent page "ja:...")
    'Draw' (button) now skips articles which have categories in the black-list 
        (defined by user)
    Categories of category or article are visible now as nodes of blue color 
        with prefix "C:". They are available through right click on the node 
        and selection of the item "Expand Categories" in the context menu. 
    Interwiki title can be added to the nodes. Select checkbox 
        Synonyms->Parameters->Iwiki, assign to 'Iwiki' text field two letters 
        language identifier. E.g. if the synonym search is applied in English 
        Wikipedia, then Iwiki could be "Ru" for Russian iwiki, or "Eo" for Esperanto.
